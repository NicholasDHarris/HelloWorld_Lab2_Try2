# Log of events:
# It had been ahwile since lab 1, so I redid the second part of lab 1 to start.
#
# When I got to Step 5.1 in Lab 2, your instructions made it look like you wanted to pull.
# from the remote branch, which I think would have deleted the Hello messages to A, B, C and D.
# So I did a remote push first. Then I added some text (writing it now) to README.md
# at GitHub so that there would be something to pull from the remote repo.
